Project idea
Reddit is a social media platform that allows users to stay anonymous. Each community or ”subreddit” has its own topics and rules enforced by subreddit moderators. The admins of Reddit only step in when there’s a public controversy or when their Terms of Service are violated. AskReddit is one of the most popular subreddits. This is the place to ask and answer thought provoking questions. With anonymity comes disadvantages. The disadvantage here is not all are useful questions, few of them are ”troll”. The moderators of AskReddit can’t remove every troll question randomly. So the aim of this project to train a model efficiently such that it detects all the troll questions and deletes them. It is a
classification problem using Natural Language Processing.
